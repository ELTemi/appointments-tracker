# Recall App
# Welcome to the Recall App.
The Recall Sinatra app is a Sinatra based application that will enable you to create, read, edit and delete appointments. I have designed a sign up page, login page and a different views page to list all your appointments


## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

$ Download and Clone this application

$ bundle install

$ shotgun

and copy the link you get to your browser

$ 174.138.35.103:60994


# Usage

To start using the application, you will need to sign up and then taken to an all appointments page. There you can fill the form to create an appointment, submit and then view the appointment you just created. You can also edit the appointments on your page and delete an appointment. At any point, you can log out of the application. This will take you to the login page. You are only allowed to view your own appointments, make changes to your appointment and delete only appointments that you have created.
